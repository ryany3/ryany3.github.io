# Market Volatility Simulator
This is my submission for the BlackRock challenge for UGA Hacks 8 to help casual investors
understand and visualize market volatility.

In this game/simulation, you will be given news alerts, and based on those, you must 
decide whether the stock (which goes by the ticker symbol $HACKS) will be
bullish (increase in value) or bearish (decrease in value).

Though this may seem straightforward, there are several mixups! I.e ambiguous 
or unhelpful events. The market isn't always easy to read!

This was written in processing for javascript (p5.js).

Is BlackRock looking for interns by any chance? 😏😏
