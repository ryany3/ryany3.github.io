# Market Volatility Simulator
This is my submission for the BlackRock challenge for UGA Hacks 8 to help casual investors
understand and visualize market volatility.

In this game/simulation, you will be given news alerts, and based on those, you must 
decide whether the stock (which goes by the ticker symbol $HACKS) will be
bullish (increase in value) or bearish (decrease in value).

Though this may seem straightforward, there are several mixups! I.e ambiguous 
or unhelpful events. Some news articles will also cause HUGE swings in price, and
others may cause smaller movements, even leading to different outcomes than one may
expect. The market isn't always easy to read!
